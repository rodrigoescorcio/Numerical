# Numerical Calculus

The project goal is to build notes on numeric algorithms presented in most Numerical Calculus courses that can be used both for theoretical learning of methods and for practical activities. All code is written as Jupyter Notebooks, using Python, therefore you can use then to study by changing the model parameters and functions from your computer. This project is done for you to experiment with the notebooks and learn better.

The full file containing all notes is [here](https://github.com/sampaio23/Numerical/blob/master/final.pdf), **but it's not finished yet**.

In order to use the material, you need to install *jupyter* in your computer. You can follow the tutorials [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), using the method that most adapt to your operational system.
